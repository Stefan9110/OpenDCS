/**
 * Samples held in Redis, which is what a deployment of more than one server uses.
 *
 * Every key is written with an expiry, so nothing here has to be swept and a run whose launcher
 * vanished takes its samples with it. Redis is asked to persist none of this: what it holds is worth
 * exactly the next poll of a chart.
 *
 * A store that cannot be reached is logged and treated as empty. Telemetry never decides anything, so
 * refusing to answer `/status` because a cache is down would turn a cosmetic outage into a real one.
